# You_Are_Registered
A registrar site that is better than the current 
University of Rochester Registrar.


It's widely accepted that the University of Rochester
has one of the worst registrar systems known to mankind. 
Crashes, bugs, unresponsive windows, hanging, etc- you
name the issue a website can have, our current registrar
site has it. Our mission: build a better registrar site,
using modern web technology like JQuery and Ajax, and 
improve the University using the very specific set of 
skills that we happen to have.
