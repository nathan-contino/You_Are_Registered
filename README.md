# You_Are_Registered
A registrar site that is better than the current 
University of Rochester Registrar.


It's widely accepted that the University of Rochester
has one of the worst registrar systems known to mankind. 
Crashes, bugs, unresponsive windows, hanging, etc- you
name the issue a website can have, our current registrar
site has it. Our mission: build a better registrar site,
using modern web technology like JQuery and Ajax, and 
improve the University using the very specific set of 
skills that we happen to have.

Proposed name: You Are Registered
Target Audience: student usage (here at the U of R)
Problem this solves: our current, terrible registrar site
How it meets minimum project specifications: allows students to sign in, select classes, check conflicts, view holds, etc.
How our project is unique/creative: For some reason, students seem really interested in writing new versions of CDCS but not in revamping the entire system that causes CDCS to be necessary. We hope to fix that.
